### Hi there everybody!!

My name is Jacob. I mainly do technology and have programmed on and off for over 10 years. I enjoy many other things such as watching movies, filming/editing videos, and playing games.

- I recently completed the Data Science track @ [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)
- Fairly versed in Python and some of it's packages (Plotly Dash, Pandas, etc.)
- I have a [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ImMzrly) where I talk about tech and do repairs and reviews.
My email is around here somewhere if you'd like to reach out to me or you can send a message to my youtube channel.
